*How I Scraped the Data
    I used the GitHub API to gather information about users in Delhi with more than 100 followers. The process involved sending GET requests to the API to retrieve user details and their repositories. I implemented pagination to ensure I captured all relevant users and their repository data efficiently. The user details were saved to users.csv, and their repositories were saved in repositories.csv.

*Interesting Findings
    One surprising discovery was the diverse range of programming languages used by developers in Delhi. While many were familiar with popular languages like Python and JavaScript, I found several users actively working with niche languages such as Rust and Elixir, indicating a growing interest in modern and emerging tech stacks.

*Recommendation for Developers
    Based on m*y analysis, I recommend that developers leverage this data to connect with peers in their region, especially those working with less common programming languages. Collaborating or contributing to projects in these areas could enhance skills, broaden professional networks, and potentially lead to job opportunities in emerging technologies.
